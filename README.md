# Clone the checkout repository.
git clone git@github.com:metalabdesign/universal-boilerplate.git

# Head on in.
cd universal-boilerplate

# Get the node version matching .nvmrc. You don't need to do this if you
# already have a sane version of node and npm installed. For allowed versions
# see `engines` in `package.json`.
nvm install

# Install all required runtime and development dependencies.
npm install

# Set required environment variables.
